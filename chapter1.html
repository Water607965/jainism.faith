        <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction to Jainism</h1>
        <p>
            Jainism is one of the oldest religions in the world, emphasizing a path of non-violence (Ahimsa), truth, and self-discipline.
            Unlike many religious traditions that depend on a creator god, Jainism is an **atheistic religion** focused on achieving liberation (Moksha) through self-realization.
        </p>

        <h2>Origins of Jainism</h2>
        <p>
            Jainism traces its roots to the **Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1300 BCE)** and later evolved through the teachings of **24 Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers)**.
            The first Tirthankara was **Rishabhanatha**, while the most well-known is **Mahavira (599–527 BCE)**, who refined the Jain doctrine.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Teachings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Ahimsa (Non-Violence)</b>: The fundamental principle of Jainism, extending beyond actions to thoughts and speech.</li>
            <li><b>Aparigraha (Non-Possessiveness)</b>: Encouraging detachment from material goods.</li>
            <li><b>Anekantavada (Many-Sided Reality)</b>: Accepting that no single viewpoint represents absolute truth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Jainism's Influence on the World</h2>
        <p>
            Jainism has significantly influenced **Indian philosophy**, **vegetarianism**, and **environmental ethics**. Figures like **Mahatma Gandhi** adopted its core teachings, particularly Ahimsa.
